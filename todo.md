- **need to implement browserclient and serverclients to authenticate api endpoints**

- backend actually needs a shit ton more work for judging to work:
    - need to allow submission to different tracks that change the judging criteria and scoring config
    - need to actually push the judging to the database

- make passcode protection for judging and organizer roles
- mentor stuff -- what are our features? What is the differentiation?
- need to use database functions for transactions
- submission time -- needs to close off


Done:
- verify passcode on judge's side
