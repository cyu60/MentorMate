# MentorMate for Stanford Demo Day - Usage Guide

This guide explains how to configure and use MentorMate's features specifically for Stanford Demo Day or similar showcase events.

## Quick Setup Guide

1. Create a new event or select an existing event
2. Navigate to the **Organizer Dashboard**
3. Go to the **Role Labels** tab to customize role names
4. Set up passwords for different roles in the **Password** tab
5. Configure tracks and set judging modes in the **Tracks** tab

## Detailed Configuration Steps

### 1. Customizing Role Labels

Demo Days typically use different terminology than hackathons. Here's how to change the labels:

1. In the Organizer Dashboard, click on the **Role Labels** tab
2. Update the labels to match Demo Day terminology:
   - Change "Judge" to "Investor"
   - Change "Participant" to "Founder"
   - Change "Mentor" to "Observer"
   - Leave "Organizer" as is
3. Click **Save Labels** to apply the changes

Once saved, the custom labels will appear throughout the platform in navigation, forms, and instructions.

### 2. Setting Up Investment-Based Judging

For Demo Days, you can configure the judging interface in two ways:

#### Option 1: Track-Specific Judging Mode (Recommended)
1. Go to the **Tracks** tab in the Organizer Dashboard
2. For each track, you'll see a "Judging Interface Mode" card
3. Select either:
   - **Traditional Scoring**: For numerical scoring against multiple criteria
   - **Investment Decision**: For binary invest/pass decisions with interest levels
4. Click "Save Changes" for each track

This approach allows different tracks to use different judging interfaces within the same event.

#### Option 2: Role Label-Based Automatic Mode
The judging interface will automatically switch to investment-focused UI when:
- The "Judge" role is relabeled as "Investor" exactly

The investment UI includes:
- Binary "Invest" or "Pass" decision
- Interest level slider (1-5) for investments
- Comments section for feedback

### 3. Password Protection

For Demo Days with sensitive investment decisions:

1. Go to the **Password** tab in the Organizer Dashboard
2. Set a password for the Investor role (previously Judge role)
3. Optionally, set passwords for other roles or make the event private
4. Share role-specific passwords only with authorized attendees

### 4. Event Configuration Best Practices

For optimal Demo Day experience:

1. **Track Setup**: 
   - Create tracks by industry vertical or investment category
   - Configure appropriate judging mode for each track
2. **Schedule**: Configure demo slots with appropriate timing blocks
3. **Resources**: Add investor-specific resources like pitch deck templates
4. **Rules**: Update rules to focus on business viability rather than technical challenge

## Role Capabilities

| Role | Access Level | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Investor** (Judge) | Password-protected | • View all submissions<br>• Make invest/pass decisions<br>• Provide feedback<br>• Indicate investment interest level |
| **Founder** (Participant) | Registration-required | • Submit startup/project<br>• Update submission details<br>• View public feedback |
| **Observer** (Mentor) | Optional password | • View all submissions<br>• Cannot make investment decisions |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Role label changes not appearing**: Refresh the page or clear browser cache
2. **Investment UI not showing**: Check the track's judging mode is set to "investment"
3. **Password issues**: Verify password is correctly set in the Password tab
4. **Track-specific settings**: Make sure to save changes for each track individually
